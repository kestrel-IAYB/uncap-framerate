# MOD NOW OBSOLETE

This mod is now no longer necessary as in the latest patch (27/09/24) the framerate cap has been removed
The mod will still function on versions below this if you are on those for some reason

# Uncap Framerate mod for I Am Your Beast

This mod:

- removes the 120 fps framerate cap that for some reason exists in the game
- allows the framerate cap slider to be set to any whole number rather than multiples of 30
- allows you to customise the bounds of the framerate slider

# Installation

!!! You need [Bepinex 6](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases/tag/v6.0.0-pre.2) for mono !!!
(if you have no idea what the versions mean try BepInEx-Unity.Mono-win-x64-6.0.0-pre.2 and it might work. maybe)

Once bepinex is installed, put the dll into the BepInEx/plugins folder in the game's root directory.

have fun :3
